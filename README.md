#Advent of Code 2022

This is my first year working on the Advent of Code challenges. I'm solving them in Javascript using nodejs. To access the data for each puzzle I'm just copying and pasting them into a data file in the same folder, and importing it using a simple fs helper function I found online....I'm sure there's a more elegant solution, but this works for now and let's me get to the problems quicker!
